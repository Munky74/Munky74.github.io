## Hello
This page exists to showcase the culmination of my undergraduate work at Southern New Hampshire University. In these pages I hope to demonstrate a mastery of the five course outcomes of the Bachelors of Science Degree in Computer Science from SNHU.

## The 5 Course Outcomes
1. Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science 
2. Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts
3. Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices (data structures and algorithms) 
4. Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals (software engineering/design/database) 
5. Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources 

### The Rescued Dog to Rescue Dog Project
The original project from my Client/Server Development course was to create a Mongo database in Linux that was connected to a front-end user interface written in Python.  The purpose of this project was to create an application that would consolidate data from different animal shelters and through a user-friendly interface aid in finding shelter dogs that would be good candidates for rescue dog training.
The original source code to this project can be found [here](https://github.com/Munky74/CS-330-Computational-Graphics/blob/main/CS-330%20Final%20Project%20Derek%20T.zip).

### To Demonstrate Mastery
To demonstrate mastery of the 5 course outcomes we have taken this project and made updates across three categories to improve the functionality and user experience.  Those categories are:
1. Software Design and Engineering
2. Algorithms and Data Structure
3. Databases

### Code Review
Before we talk about the improvements we've made to our application please take a minute to watch my informal code review of the original project. These videos hosted on YouTube will highlight the current features of our application as well as the problems that we will seek to address in our updated project.
